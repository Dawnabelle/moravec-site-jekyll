## ESRI Award Winning Application
###  City of **Houston** Hack-a-thon 2015 

Built for the Houston 2015 Hackathon, we wanted a way to find authentic food in the Houston area.  Houston is a melting pot of cultures and has excellent dishes and restaurants from all over the world, but where do you find them?  We analyzed Houstonâ€™s restaurant data to figure out where they were, and what we found was interesting, similar flavors group together, go ahead and try it out!
