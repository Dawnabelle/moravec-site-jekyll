Pipeline companies around the world use Risk management techniques to better understand the assets they manage.  All engineered structures, like pipelines, require ongoing maintenance to ensure their safe operating.  The Frontier Series of Pipeline Risk Software strives to be a simple, open-algorithm tool that allows users to manage their own Risk (instead of relying on a “black-box” algorithm.  The tool uses a quantitative approach (meaning probabilities and values based on scientific facts) and simple graphs and automation to simplify the Risk analysis process.  This is a joint project between WKM Consultancy and Moravec Labs, you can find out more about the software and download your free copy at the website.
