title:  "Vote with Ease"
---
Our team created the winning app for Esriâ€™s Hackathon at the Esri Developer Summit in 2014.  Our app aimed to help people get out and vote by routing them to the nearest polling location with the shortest line, and minimizing the total time they would have to spend voting.  Our team of five had 20 hours to create the apps consisting of a mobile site for routing, a Windows touch app to educate voters about candidates and a server system to communicate with residents via text message.
