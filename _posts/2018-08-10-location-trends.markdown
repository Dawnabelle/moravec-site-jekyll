*Location is often dismissed as a way to 'put something on a map', but can we see more than just points on a map?*

In this talk we will *explore methods of extracting location and time trends from data* – and plotting that data and extracting meaning for our users beyond just location. We will cover everything from hot-spot analysis vs heat maps to plotting location trends over time and even filtering common locations.

We’ll also take a special look at some Google Location History to figure out what types of information we can extract from knowing where a person has been before and what we can predict from it.
