We are just weeks away from the 2018 [Esri User Conference]("https://www.esri.com/en-us/about/events/uc/overview") in gorgeous San Diego, California. As a member of the *Esri Startup Program*, the Esri UC is one of the events we are most excited to attend this year.

This conference brings together tens of thousands of members of the Esri community from map markers all over the globe. It is a fabulous opportunity to connect with our customers and partners, make new friends, and share the exciting work we’ve been doing at Moravec Labs.

In the last year we’ve seen a lot of innovation in the Esri ecosystem and we can’t wait to share our thoughts with you. Here’s some fun little projects we’ve been working on that we’d love to chat with you about.

* Our new GIS chatbot will help you *find the nearest tree to hug* or the closest park to meet a friend for lunch.
* An IoT temperature sensor for the office so you’ll always know whether to bring a sweater or something lighter for swelter summer days.
* [GeoTools.xyz]("https://www.geotools.xyz/") gives you an easy way to do some common GeoDev tasks. For example, Where is that lat/long? or What is the extent of a map if I center it on Portland, OR?

Hope to see you July 9th in San Diego!
