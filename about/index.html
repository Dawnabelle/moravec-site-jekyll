<p><strong>Moravec Labs</strong> is a small, unpretentious startup located in the heart of Portland, OR.</p><P>We focus primarily on GIS software and technology, without being limited to only one vendor or stack. We often combine commercial tools from enterprise vendors, such as Esri and Microsoft, with open-source software, like Python and GDAL, to build the complete solutions our clients desire.</p>

        <p>I founded Moravec Labs in 2016 to focus on leveraging technology to solve business problems. After being in the industry for over 10 years and watching organizations struggle with processes and software that didn’t often work the way they needed it to or thought it would, I knew I could make a difference. I customize software solutions, so you don’t have to. I believe that technology should help us and should make us better; you shouldn't have to change your thought processes and methods just because the software doesn't support it!<br/><br/>
        At Moravec Labs, I work primarily on software architecture and design, but I write code every day that goes into our applications. These days, I write mostly in TypeScript, C#, Java and Python but I have spent many years working in Server Architecture, GIS Applications, Work Process Engineering, SQL and more ArcGIS software that I care to admit.
    <br/><br/>
        In my free time I enjoy researching and learning new technologies, tinkering with gadgets, and working in my garden.</p>
