# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  Software exists all around us. How do we differentiate between good and not so good software? At Moravec Labs, we believe good software tells a story. It is intuitive. Users donâ€™t need to understand all the aspects of an application to use it. We consider the story that the software needs to tell as well as the story the map is telling. Are the stories the same? Do they complement each other? At Moravec Labs, we weave these stories together to tell a comprehensive and fluid story for the user.
