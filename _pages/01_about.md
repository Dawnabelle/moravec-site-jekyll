**Moravec Labs** is a small, unpretentious startup located in the heart of Portland, OR. We focus primarily on GIS software and technology, without being limited to only one vendor or stack. We often combine commercial tools from enterprise vendors, such as Esri and Microsoft, with open-source software, like Python and GDAL, to build the complete solutions our clients desire.
<br/>
The Moravec Labs team works on a wide variety of projects with clientele from natural resources, construction, and environmental industries. We are proud to be the preferred software development company at several key for-profit and non-profit organizations across the globe. We perform full software life-cycle support, from creation to maintenance to migration, as something we like to call Software Development as a Service. Some of our current projects include custom mobile data collection software, data processing automation, and custom web development.
<br/>
Our mission is to boldly create the most excellent solutions possible for our clients. We combine the best available technology with passionate developers to build value for our clients. As a small startup, we have the freedom and the bandwidth to entertain unconventional ideas and are continuously exploring projects in exciting areas like augmented reality and machine learning. We strive to advance both technology, and ourselves, through professional growth and the continual diversification into emerging and unique industries.

__Christopher Moravec__ 
<br/>
CEO and lead developer at Moravec labs
<br/><br/>
I founded Moravec Labs in 2016 to focus on leveraging technology to solve business problems. After being in the industry for over 10 years and watching organizations struggle with processes and software that didn’t often work the way they needed it to or thought it would, I knew I could make a difference. I customize software solutions, so you don’t have to. I believe that technology should help us and should make us better; you shouldn't have to change your thought processes and methods just because the software doesn't support it!<br/>
At Moravec Labs, I work primarily on software architecture and design, but I write code every day that goes into our applications. These days, I write mostly in TypeScript, C#, Java and Python but I have spent many years working in Server Architecture, GIS Applications, Work Process Engineering, SQL and more ArcGIS software that I care to admit.
<br/>
In my free time I enjoy researching and learning new technologies, tinkering with gadgets, and working in my garden.<br/><br/>
