Hello. My name is Christopher Moravec and I am the lead developer and CEO of Moravec Labs. In my free time I enjoy researching and learning new technologies, tinkering with gadgets, and working on community projects. Ever since I was a little kid I have been fascinated with airplanes which led to me obtaining my Private Pilot Certificate in 2014.<br/><br/>
I work mainly on software architecture and design but I spend as much time as I can writing code and building tests with my team. My technical background includes Python, Server Architecture, Server Design, Server Planning, GIS Applications, Work Process Engineering, T-SQL, PL/SQL, C#, Mobile Development, and more ArcGIS than should be allowed!<br/><br/>


At __Moravec Labs__, we focus on building great GIS applications for our users and related processes. Moravec Labs is proud to be a member of the Esri Startup Program.
